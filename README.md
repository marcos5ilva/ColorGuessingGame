#ColorGuessingGame

This is the SECOND assessment from the HTML CSS JavaScript course, for a series of courses that comprise the Coursera's Full Stack Web Development Specialization.
The assessment task requires us to make a simple color guessing game, the objective is for the player guess the color randomly chosen from a list of limited number of colors.

There are 2 parts of this assignment:

Part 1 - A simple version of the game. A target color is randomly selected, the player insert his guess color, if it's match with the target color the game is finished, otherwise the loop start again.

Part 2 - The complete game, including a feedback for the player, informing of him if his color guess is  positioned alphabetically  higher or lower  compared with the target color.
